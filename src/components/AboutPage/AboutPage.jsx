        (Bling) $(mySkin) is an innovative, state-of-the-art, breaking new ground, original, 
        cutting-edge app that lets you keep track of your skin care process through the means of taking and 
        uploading pictures of your face profile. This will let you see a series of photo 
        timeline of your skin condition and if the skincare products you are currently 
        using are working or not. You also have the option to add any skincare product 
        that you are currently using, have used in the past or are looking to use in the 
        future into a list of products in its own section page. This is to help you keep 
        track of your skincare product to let you determine if the product is worth keeping 
        or scraping it.
